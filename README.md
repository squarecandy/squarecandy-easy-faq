## Getting Started

* run `npm install` in the plugin directory
* run `grunt` to listen for changes to your scss files and to compile them immediately as you work
* All commit messages must follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) standard.
* always run `grunt preflight` to make sure all linting passes before you commit.
